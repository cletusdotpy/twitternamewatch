# twitternamewatch
Quick script to monitor username availability on Twitter. For the homies.

Requires Twitter API access (only got charged $80 for the $100 tier ðŸ’¸)
Limited to one call every ~173 seconds (based on API tier limit of 500 app requests per 24 hrs... anyway thanks for $20 off..)

Plays an annoying beep for 5 seconds and exits when the "created" date for the username no longer exists (indicating the account has been deleted)
